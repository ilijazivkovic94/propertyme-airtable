*** Emily Brauner *** 26/11/2018 12:19:55 PM
Good morning,

Could you please kindly advise the colour of the walls at 1 Pamphlet Street in Palmview.

The tenants accidentally damaged a wall when moving in and need to patch and paint, however they have said the paint left at the property does not match the walls.

Thank you so very much for your help.

*** Tash Moores  *** 22/11/2018 1:09:38 PM
Hi Tash,

Sorry it’s taken so long to get back to you. After some discussion we have decided to approve the tenants request for this particular dog.
Regards 
Steve 

*** Tash Moores  *** 13/11/2018 2:48:59 PM
Good Afternoon Geri & Steve,

I hope you both are having a lovely week so far. 

I have received an email from the tenants seeking approval for a dog, please see below -

Hi Hannah

Just a follow up with the alarm system for the house.
The new code stored from the other week when I changed it is 4644, and there should be instructions in the book that I brought in the other week on how to change it for any new tenancy.

Also the cost for back to base monitoring for this system is approx $600 per year.

Cheers

I just spoke with Clinton from Aussie pest control and I did not state in my email for the termite inspection only and rather said pest inspection.......so that is what they have done.
All good, but if you can kindly get back in touch and request they go back and carry out the termite inspection at the earliest convenience please.

Furthermore if you can get them to email me the invoice direct.

Cheers and sorry for any confusion.

Have a great weekend!

G'day Tash / Hannah

Thanks for the inspection report.

Before you contact Scaussie electrical to repair the isolator switch, is it possible we can find out from Man-corp if this would be covered under warranty?
If not then yes please go ahead and organise the repair at your earliest convenience and ask that the invoice be kindly emailed to myself when complete.
Also our pest inspections on both properties are due this month so if you could kindly organise these to be completed at your earliest convenience please.
Contact - Aussie Pest Control (Clinton Taylor) on 07 5443 3035 or 0418 711 323

Also have the tenants given any feedback to our reply on their request to have a fence installed or any info on AV Jennings covenants on fences if we wish to proceed?

Cheers and have a great weekend!

Hi Hannah,

We have an issue with our dishwasher it seems that there is no water coming into the dishwasher with the error code e2 displayed. I have attached a photo for you to see and I have looked up to see if it’s something we could fix but it seems like we may need a plumber/sparky. If possible as well can we get someone to replace the washers on the tap in our kitchen as it seems to be quite tight and leaking. 

Kind Regards,
Ash

Hi Hannah 
Sorry have been a bit busy with work and uni and have put it off but the tap in the bathroom hasn't been fixed yet. We should have got back to you a lot sooner about not seeing the plumber is it possible to get it fixed?

Good afternoon Mark,

I hope you're well and have had a great week.

Kiara from Elite Garage Door Repairs called end of last week, advising she had spoken with you to arrange a quote and was seeking the tenants details which I provided.

I have not heard anything further however she did advise she would speak with you directly once quoted.

In the meantime, I followed up with Smart Doors and they have finally sent through the quote. My apologies for the delay. Please find attached for your consideration. 

Smart Doors advised if are happy to proceed, they would recommend that they have a discussion with you or meet onsite to discuss.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thanks so very much.

*** Emily Brauner *** 9/11/2018 11:14:12 AM
Good morning Mark,

Thank you for your email.

I have sent a pest control work order to Matt at Suncoast Pest. I have also sent a quote request to Smart Doors (as they would be the best tradespeople to complete the job) to quote to strip off the timber and replace with colorbond or similar alternative material with a recommendation of colours to suit the facade.

However, would you like me to send a quote request to our handyman to repair the garage door frame and large crack above to the right?

As soon as I have received the quote from Smart Doors, I will be sure to forward onto you for your consideration.

Have a lovely weekend.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me on 07 5438 0090.

*** Emily Brauner *** 8/11/2018 2:27:21 PM
Emily, Happy to get the pest control done which includes ants.  Can you please get the handy man to give us a quote to strip off the timber and put on colour bond or another suitable material.

The quote for the side gate from Ron from All Done Property Services has been received. Please find attached for your consideration.

I have not heard back from your tenant Bradley, I do know he works away so may be unable to return my calls. 

Please kindly let me know how you would like to proceed with the attached quote and also regarding the quote for the two showers.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Thanks so very much.

Good morning Benn,

I am so much better, thanks so much :) I hope you had a great weekend too!

I left a message for your tenant Bradley last week on Friday and hope to hear back from him soon regarding the fence and side gate. As the wood in the ground is loose and wobbly, I would say it is beginning to rot. In the meantime, I have sent a quote request to Ron from All Done Property Services to quote to either repair and/or replace.

Mark from Tile Rescue has advised they are closing their business this week and unfortunately are unable to quote. However, I had also contacted Peter from Groutpro. Please see below email.

""Hi Emily
The average shower is $110 to resilicone
That’s 4 wall floor joints and some replacement for the wall silicone
I completely remove old silicone treat the joints for Mould and replace with new silicone 
If you work with this figure it will save disruption for the tenants 
If you require any further information please contact me 
Many Thanks

Please kindly let me know if you would like to proceed with the quote from Groutpro. It would be approximately $220 for the two showers. The ensuite shower is the main concern with a number of areas peeling and breaking away, however the main bathroom shower has a little bit of peeling with some small holes so could also benefit with new silicone. Please let me know if you would like to have both showers resiliconed or just the ensuite at this stage. 

We would love for you to come by and say hi, pop in anytime!! :)

Have a great week, I look forward to hearing from you.

Hope you have a great weekend! I might have to pop in and see you sometime :)

Good morning Benn,

Thank you for your email.

I hope you've been well and had a great week too! My apologies for the delay in my reply, I was away the first half of the week with a chest infection.

Yes absolutely, no worries at all, I have contacted council on your behalf and have requested a green waste bin be delivered. 

I will speak with your tenant Bradley regarding fixing the fence palings and side gate. I do believe the whole side gate would benefit from being replaced rather than fixed as it is rotting and could worsen and become a hazard. Would you like me to see if Bradley can fix, however it may only be temporary. Also, to confirm, are you happy to reimburse them through the rent for the products sourced once the job is completed and the receipts are received?

I am waiting to hear back from Mark at Tile Rescue for the quote to re-silicone the showers.

I have also arranged for Mobbs Electrical to repair the exhaust fan and have asked them to quote to install a split system air conditioner.

Thanks so very much.

Have a great weekend!

Good Afternoon Emily,


Apologies for the late reply but I hope you are having a great week! Even though its only Tuesday!

Just had a quick read through the routine inspection report and all seems to be happy..
In regards to the maintenance, I am happy for you to organise a green waste bin for the tenants if you are able to?
Also happy for the side gate to be fixed (either by the tenants if he is a qualified carpenter) as well as the palings on the back fence.
If you can please organise a quote on resealing the shower that would be excellent!

In regards to the exhaust fan, I'm happy to get that fixed and perhaps ask if the electrician can do up a quick quote for cost and installation of a new air conditioner?

Any Problems please let me know

And also what the $150 smoke alarm fee covers?

Hi Michelle

We have heard back from the owner of 12 Indigo Road and he has agreed to pay the $300 NBN installation fee.

As the account will be in your name he will be unable to pay this directly so please go ahead and organise with your provider and send us a copy of the invoice once you have received it.

Could you get the installers to invoice me direct.

Hi Hannah,
Just thought we should let you know that when we moved in there was little gas and we had a full bottle fitted to the gas line fittings on the side of the house.  One bottle run out and we had to switch to the new bottle of gas.  When doing so, the flexible line from the LPG bottle to the fitting on the the house is leaking gas.  We had to swap the bottle to the other line (solid pipe/line).
Thinking this may be an issue you should be aware of.  
Please contact us for any more information

Good afternoon Jason and Lorraine, 
I hope you had a great weekend. 
I had arranged for the handy man to look at the kitchen sink, however your new tenants have mentioned that the waste under the ensuite sink is leaking (He has tried to tighten this himself with no luck) and also the toilet cistern continues to run. 
Are you happy for me to arrange a plumber to attend to the kitchen sink and the other two ideas instead of the handy man. 
Thank you very much.

Morning Hannah,

Happy to move forward with this, please tell Mobbs not to both with the three year extra warranty for the item I believe the unit comes with a 2 year factory warrant.

Have a great day hope the weather up your way is better then what we have in Sydney at the moment.

Kind regards

Hi Hannah,

Thank you for all the time you spent with Shane and Luke we have reached a good outcome regarding all works conducted and ongoing. Sorry for the delay in getting back to you with regards to the rangehood I didn’t forget about it I have just been flat to the boards with work. 

Please see attached link for the rangehood I would like to go ahead with if Mobbs electrical can order install this one and match the price with the three year warranty that would be fantastic.

https://www.appliancesonline.com.au/omega-slideout-rangehood-ort6wxa/

I’ll be in the office this week if you need to get hold of me for any reason hope you have a great weekend.

Kind regards

Good afternoon Brad, 

I hope you had a great weekend. 

Thank you very much for your email and so glad to hear that you were able to reach a good outcome with Prime regarding the works at your property. 

I have emailed Mobbs and will check that they can price match the rangehood you have sent through and if so I will get them to go ahead :) 

Will let you know if there are any issues with it. 

Have a great week ahead

Hi Hannah,
There is a lot of subsidence with this ground. Down the side of the patio area, no grass ever grows there. I recommend installing stone or reconcreting to get rid of this muddy area. Out the back, there is a drain in the yard that you could look at teeing into and running some channel grate drain along the back of the patio to the fence line. This would take away any of the surface water that runs towards the house. The grass looks pretty good on this side of the house as it gets a lot of sun. We will also need to raise the drain at the side of the house.  
The owners would organise with a landscaper to install stone, or a concreter to reconcete, and take away a fair bit of dirt. 
The plumbing component would cost $1550 inc GST. 
Let me know if you have any problems or if the owners would like to proceed. 

Kind Regards,
Dave

HI Hannah,
We have no information regarding a roof issue at handover. If there is an issue with the roof tiles now , then it has more than likely been caused by someone walking on the roof or the electrical contractor moving the tile above to install the light.
Prime are not liable for this work.

However could you please start advertising the house in your shop window, and put a Lease sign out the front of the house in case we have any prospective tenants go past and have interest

Good Afternoon Tammy & Mark,

After discussions with the team we have agreed that we should leave commencement of re-advertising 14 Apple Crescent until closer to the tenants vacating date.

We would like to propose commencing advertisement around the 19th September. 

1. Because generally prospective tenants will not be looking at properties that far in advance.

2. Because the advertisement will continue to move further down on Real Estate.com the longer it is advertised for.

Could you please let me know your thoughts at your earliest convenience.

Good afternoon Hannah 

As requested, please find a copy of the insurance for 14 Apple Cres Caloundra West. 

At this stage I will not make a decision on the termite and building inspection until I know if the tenants will be renewing their lease. 

If they do not renew their lease we will do the inspection at the time we prepare the house for new tenants. 

If they renew we will discuss further. Thanks for getting the quotes

Hi again Hannah,
Apologies as I’ve had a really busy past two weeks with student reports to read for over 950 students… my eyes are going a bit blurry… hence it’s taken me a while to reply to your three emails…

As the third email reply to get back up to date for you:

We’ve decided for this first year to NOT get the annual building inspection carried out. We feel that as the property is so new (and being looked after well by yourselves and the tenant, Kelly ??) it is not necessary at present. We will consider again in 12 months time.

We originally had ‘Accurate Pest Management’ carry out the termite management treatment (on 5th June 2017, Cert# i03254) and would like them to provide an inspection. I am emailing them to also ask if they can provide a pest inspection and treatment (spiders, etc as well as the moth/grub on the entertainment area roof Kelly (tenant) has mentioned). I am asking them to liaise with you to arrange your permission, access, payment, etc. I will cc you into the email trail…
Much thanks,
Nick & Michelle Thomson

Hi guys,

Our property at 14 Marybell Dr, Baringa (formerly Lot 681 Marybell, Aura) was treated by you for termites (TERM-Seal Termite Management System) on 5 June 2017 at completion of construction (cert# i03254).

As it is now 12 months we’d like you to organise a routine termite inspection, however as the property is leased through Positive Property People, Caloundra we ask you to contact Hannah Reed, property manager (p: 5438 0900) to arrange access and payment post inspectio

Attached is the Waranty info/activation (not certain I sent it through 12 months ago…)

Our tenant has mentioned a moth/grub on the entertainment area roof (may be affecting the lawn?) and regular spider/insect/pests will need inspection and treatment as well if you provide this service. Again, please liaise with Hannah from Positive Property People as all decisions, paperwork, payment, etc. will be completed through her.
Much thanks,

Hi Hannah,
Thanks for the info from Kelly about the lawns. It looks from the photos like the narrow side of the house will always struggle to get enough sun to grow lawn. Let her know we’re happy for her to mulch and garden where she feels necessary. It looks like she’s doing a great job. A shady fern garden is fine by us!

Hi thanks for that i will fix all problems cheers

*** Tash Moores  *** 30/07/2018 1:03:50 PM
Good morning Ben,

Thanks for your time on the phone this morning and for sending through the water bill.

After Emily and I conducted the tenants exit report on Friday, I'd like to bring to your attention the following items - 

1. The door handle to Bedroom 3 is loose and requires tightening

2. 1 x Heat Lamp requires replacing in the main Bathroom. After informing the tenants that they would be required to replace this, they have advised that the bulb is a reoccurring issue - every time the tenants replace the bulb it blows again.

Could you please advise how you would like to proceed with these items. I would recommend getting the heat lamp inspected by an electrician. 

Thank you very much.

Hi Hannah, 
Just updating you on the work order for the above property. We did have it booked in for this afternoon, however the tenant forgot our appointment as well as our technician went home sick so we have rescheduled it for the 22nd April. If there are any issues, please contact our office on 5452 7005. Thank-you!
Kind Regards,
Madi King

Hi Hannah,
I have attached the lease renewal form and also the latest Unity water bill.
If the tenants still wanted to put up curtains in the master bedroom only, we would consider it as long as they are in a neutral colour.
Thanks

Good afternoon,
Apologies for delay in response to your original email, however  as discussed with your office today we are currently unsure if we need to continue on with the lease.
At the moment CD Excavations is currently renting this property for its employees who are currently working on one our jobs in Caloundra. The first stage of this job is due to finish  in a couple of weeks and we have not received confirmation on whether we were successful with the next stage of work  due to start around June/July.
So with that said we would like to request, if possible, a periodical lease, month by month until we receive confirmation on the next stage of work. We are hoping that we will receive this confirmation by no later than July this year.
We apologise for any inconvenience that this may cause and we look forward to your reply.
Kind Regard
Dion Tooley

Morning Hannah

Warranty has just ran out on the dishwasher.

If you could kindly have Kerr's electrical attend at their earliest convenience please, noting that if it is anything related to user maintenance (I.E - dirty filter, or large food scraps in the plug area) then it may be down to user error as we had this issue with the previous tenants at Northcote.
Maybe a heads up to the tenants first to ensure it is clean and free of any food scraps?

Please call if you need to chat further.

Thanks Emily. Yes I understand re the date but as they are not leaving until end of Jan all the tradies and workplaces are back to work well and truly by then I’m sure all will be fine.

Isn’t it crazy all these insurance rules and liabilities and so a kind offer gets wiped out the door because of it. It’s a changed world we live in now!

Have a lovely Christmas break. 

Cheers

Stephanie

*** Administrator *** 21/12/2017 3:40:38 PM
Hello Stephanie,

Thank you for your email. Yes we can change the date to the 2nd of February, however please note, particularly due to the time of year we have found in the past it can be quite difficult for tradespeople if needed to attend to repairs with only a days notice. I will amend the date to Friday, 2nd February now for you.

Regarding the garage, it is very lovely to offer, however due to insurance reasons, we do not allow tenants access to the property until their lease commences.

Thanks so much.


*** Administrator *** 21/12/2017 3:40:37 PM
Hi Emily

 

The ad looks good…..just a couple of things….

 

I was not able to find the dates available for inspection. I could find the request for a date but not any advertised dates….maybe I am doing something wrong.

 

Also If the current tenants vacate on 30th Jan, as they are responsible for everything being clean and in total order, we would like to rent from Friday 2 Feb. That gives the agency 2 complete days for inspection report and any other small things that may need to be brought up to scratch. It is more than likely the current tenants will move out on the weekend before too. We also like to give tenants the weekend to move in rather than starting from a Monday. If the tenants request to move gear a day earlier…particularly anything in to the garage we like to be flexible with that.

 

Cheers

 

Happy Christmas

 

Stephanie

Good afternoon Stephanie,

Thank you for your call earlier. We have advertised 19 Sienna Street at $525 per week as discussed.

Please see link to your property: https://www.realestate.com.au/property-house-qld-caloundra+west-417788582

Hope you have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!

*** Administrator *** 21/12/2017 3:40:13 PM
Good morning Stephanie,

Thank you for your email. Yes, we can certainly advertise for $520 per week. Yes, that's very true, a lot of good tenants do have pets, we have amended the listing to ""pets on application"" for you. Please see below copy of the write up. We would love to advertise today for you, so please let us know if you are happy with the below as soon as possible and we can begin marketing Sienna Street.

""This immaculately presented 4 bedroom + study home has a fantastic floor plan for families. With a separate wing to close the bedrooms off from main living spaces, the kids can sleep while you entertain. You’ll love the comfort of 2 completely separate living areas, air-conditioning to main bedroom and living.
Features include:

Bright and airy kitchen designed for families with loads of bench-space (stone), heaps of extra crockery and pot drawers, 900mm canopy rangehood, fridge plumbing, dishwasher, wall oven, double pantry.

A cleverly designed separate wing creates privacy for the kids or guests, with bedrooms 2,3,4 and the main bathroom able to be closed off from the rest of the home, all leading off an open study. All these bedrooms have double built-ins and easily fit queen beds.

Large laundry with in-bench tub, extra cabinets, space for dryer or extra fridge and easy line access.

The double remote garage is the ideal setup for a home business complete with timber look flooring and extra plumbing/power.

HI Emily

 

Further to my email earlier today my husband and I would like to ask $520 for Sienna St. I have done some further investigation in to the Sunshine Coast market through our financial adviser and we believe $520 is not at all unreasonable. We have also heard 2 stories of 2 houses renting in one day for $10 more than the asking price. It would seem that the rental market is pretty hot on the Sunshine Coast right now. 45 Cobalt Street has also just rented for $500 and has no media room, no study, no aircon, in the main bedroom and not a remote garage and is quite a small house.

 

We would like pets to be on request……we would prefer no pets but we do realise a lot of people do have pets these days.

 

We would appreciate if we could see an ad copy before it goes live.

 

We would like the ad to be up over the Christmas period when some people may have days off to search the net.

 

Thanks Emily.

 

Stephanie

 

*** Administrator *** 21/12/2017 3:39:56 PM
HI Emily

 

Thank you for the email re Sienna St. Yes we are keen to start advertising.

 

I have looked fairly thoroughly on Real estate.com and Domain and have found there are a number of houses with less features than ours and asking more than $490 and all in Caloundra West. Below are the houses I have used as a comparison:

 

69 Marybell St is advertised for $490 and has no aircon, no media room and no study

 

90 Steiner Crescent is $520. It is new but has no media room and no study

 

5 Wilkinson St  is $520 and also has no media room and no study

 

31 Lime Cres is $525 and is only 3 beds (advertised as 4 but the 4th is actually the media room). Definitely not as good as Sienna and is asking $525

 

77 Marybell Dr is similar to ours but no study and is $500

 

Based on the above properties being advertised at the same time as ours we feel $510 is a fair price and not being unrealistic. We do not want to be unrealistic and have our house unrented of course but do want to get the best return.

 

When would you commence advertising and would this be based on open houses at certain times and do you do open houses on Saturdays?

 

I look forward to hearing from you.

 

Kind regards

Good morning Hannah

I have organised the removal of the spa from the property for Monday 8
January. Wayne may be able to do it on the Friday before and will let me
know just after New Year if that is the case. There will also be an
electrician onsite to fix the wiring when the spa comes out and we are going
to organise a light in the gazebo if there is not one there already. Wayne
will not be removing all the plumbing but cutting and capping in accordance
with WH&S requirements. Depending on the state of the floor when the spa is
removed we may have that done as well so it maybe more than a 1 day job.

I have given Wayne your contact details to liaise with you.

May I take this opportunity to wish you and your family, friends, and

We have made a decision with regard to Sienna Street work.
We are removing the decking area altogether and replacing with turf. We are removing the log stepping stones and replacing with stepping pavers. This will make for less maintenance hassles down the track.

Hi Hannah,

Ok I get it now.

I think just get the termite one done and leave the building inspection 
if you haven’t arranged it yet.

Thanks,


*** Hannah Reed *** 2/06/2018 10:33:04 AM
Morning Hannah,

Sorry for only getting back to you now.
You can proceed getting it fixed.

Good morning Nola, 
I hope you have had a great week. 
The plumber has attended to the water filter and has replaced the leaking stop tap to the filter, however they have advised that the filter system itself is also leaking. 
The cost to replace the filter including labour and materials is $265 inc gst. 


*** Hannah Reed *** 24/02/2018 9:26:55 AM
Morning Hannah,
Ahhhh that’s sad that they are moving, but ist fine they can
stay as long as they need to. They must just give you enough notice.
When they move out Gerhard and I just want to clean up the garden before the next tenants move in.
Have a nice weekend ??
Regards,
Nola

Hi Hannah,

Thanks for getting the quote.

They can proceed fixing the gate and then just let 
them forward the invoice to me to pay.

You have a great weekend too.

Many Thanks,
Nola

Hi Hannah,

Here's invoice INV-0791 for 106.92 AUD. Please note that the rainwater tank pump pressure controller check valve was damaged. This part cannot be replaced. Dave can permanently bypass the rainwater tank (leaving rainwater permanently in the tank) or it can be replaced for $1389 supply and install. Let me know if the owners would like to proceed with any further works.

*** Hannah Threlfall *** 30/05/2016 12:47:49 PM
tenant phoned on Sat and said pump is not working and is making a noise - I told him to turn it off at the wall to power for now and I will arrange repair on Monday - rang and spoke with Nola and she said to go ahead and get a plumber out to have a look and send a quote if it is going to be costly

Good Afternoon Ray & Janelle, 

I have received an email and photo's from the tenants about the NBN Battery and also the garage door, please see below - 

""Hi all
Just a couple of things....
The NBN box in the garage cupboard has started beeping, red light on suggesting battery needs replacing. Also the garage door is radomly popping back up a little, but not every time we close it. Photos attached 

Kind regards
Sarah & Lester""

The NBN battery would require replacing at a cost of $36.00 from Battery World, I can check with the tenants if they would be happy to install the battery otherwise our handyman would charge $74.00. Could you please advise how you would like to proceed. 

Also I have contacted Smart Garage Doors regarding the garage door issue (same issue as last service) and they have advised as the last service was in August last year the door would require another service. Could you please advise if you would be happy for me to arrange the service (cost $110.00 Including GST)

Thank you very much.

Good morning Kym, 
Thank you very much for your email and I hope you had a lovely weekend. 
Yes there are only 3 ceiling fans in the property - 1x Lounge room, 1x Main bedroom & 1x Bedroom 4. 
I will give them the go ahead to replace with option B for $681. 
Have a great day.

Whilst we were conducting our exit at the property I noticed that both of the toilet roll holder were not on the walls, the tenants had not notified us about this.

Hi Hannah. 
There wont be a call out fee for the plumber. But it will be really important they dry out the carpet and under the tub to stop any mould developing. If there was anything to fix later on it could be done through insurance with a possible excess for the tenant to pay.  
Maybe just stress the importance of drying out properly.

Ed and I have just left 23 wood. 
The heater is now working. I had the installer pop over. The fan was getting stuck in the compressor but this has now been fixed.
The TVs just needed to be tuned. There was nothing wrong with the connection.  Ed showed the son how to do it. Mum and the girls left the house.
The issue with the wet carpet was use error. Their washing machine hose was faulty and water was leaking. I was able to get a plumber their. He connected thier hot water hose to the cold water and it is now working fine. I will send you a pic if where the water has escaped from and into the bedroom behind. 
I put the ceiling fan on high in the bedroom and openwd the window tgis should dry the carpet pretty quickly.  We also set up a pedistal fan up near the laundry tub to try to dry out the tiles inder the tub. I let the son know this should be left on overnight as it was very wet.

Sent from tenant:
Have just had NBN Co come out to install the infrastructure on the house. Unfortunately when the builder has built the house the they have connected the house to the wrong NBN pit. As a result NBN can not connect the house until the correct pit has been upgraded. This may come at a higher cost. Now as this problem has no way anything to do with myself this cost would have to be passed onto the owner as it was part of the construction of the house.

Once i receive confirmation of costing and timing i will pass this on. It may pay to inform the owner as the builder of his house has not completed it correctly.

Damien has also said that if Jason renews his lease next year he will reimburse the full cost of set up, so another $150 to be deducted from rent payment following new lease sign up. Agreed with Jason.

Have emailed the owners about NBN connection as per tenants request.

Good afternoon Hayden,

Thank you for your email regarding the garage door.

It sounds as though the garage motor requires a service. I have contacted the owners and hope to hear back from them soon.

Please do not hesitate to let me know if there is anything else I can do to assist.

Have a great afternoon.

Hello Danny and Nadia,

I hope you're well and having a great week so far.

We have received the below email from your tenants regarding the garage door.

""Hi,
Recently our garage door has been opening by itself. We have been watching tv and hearing it open with no one else home.

Please inform on how to proceed. 

Regards

Hayden""

It sounds as though the garage motor requires a service. We generally recommend this is completed yearly to keep the garage door in good working order. This will cost $110.00 by Smart Doors. If it requires any addition work or parts, this may increase.

Please kindly advise if you would like to proceed with the service.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Have a lovely day.

I have spoken with your tenants and they are very appreciative of you purchasing and installing the dryer to become a permanent fixture.

Have a great day.

Hello Hayden, Madeline and Nathan,

I hope you had a great weekend.

I have heard back from the owners regarding your picture hook request and dryer bracket.

They are happy for you to hang some pictures on the 3m hooks, however have said if any damage occurs to the paint, it will need to be repaired to a professional standard.

The owners have also said they would like to look into providing and installing the dryer at their expense to become a permanent fixture to the property. I am sourcing some quotes for their consideration and will let you know from there.

Thanks so very much.

*** Emily Brauner *** 8/10/2018 2:32:08 PM
Good afternoon Nadia,

My sincere apologies for the delay in my reply.

I hope you had a great weekend.

I have let your tenants know they are welcome to place 3m hooks on the walls and have explained they are responsible for any damage caused.

Regarding the dryer, I will contact the Good Guys and arrange a quote for your consideration. 

*** Emily Brauner *** 8/10/2018 2:31:58 PM
Good afternoon,

Thank you for your email.

Please advise tenants in order to place 3m hooks on the wall, we agree to provided they are aware of holding responsibility to any damages to paint surfaces. 

Regarding the drying rack, we have reviewed that majority of dryers do come with it when purchased and would prefer to look at doing it ourselves, that way it is part of the house fixture and is installed professionally.

Do you recommend any providers for the dryer and installation? 

Kind regards

Nadia

Hi Hannah,
Do you know if this damage was caused by an ongoing water leak?

If so, I’d be most appreciative if you could get your handyman out to simply seal from the outside,

Or if it is an actual window seal problem let us know and I’ll try and arrange service call with the manufacturer

Could you possibly call me in regards to other outstanding QLD issues,

Apologies for the delayed response, all my focus goes on work at the moment :-)

With the NBN can we negotiate half and half?

Also for the day they move in, I would like to get something for them like a bottle of Champagne, or wine or if they aren't drinkers some chocolates and some flowers...Is their a way you can you suss out on the down low what they might like? Obviously it would be nice if it where a surprise :-)

Also, I have just purchased Landlord and tenancy insurance for Terri Sheer, commencing 6th April (which is hand over date?) just waiting on Danny to set up a nominated email account for the rent to go to, then we will sign and scan page 7 of the form 6 that is required.

Morning Hannah,
I have booked a maintenance check and clean of the solar system for the above property.
It is booked in with Halcol Energy for Thursday 10.05.18 between 7:00am and 8:30am.  I am not sure where the invertor for this system is, in the garage or on the side of the house.  If it is in the garage the tenants will need to be home for this to be accessed.  They will also need to get onto the roof to check and clean the panels so may need access to the back yard. 
If this date and time is not suitable for the tenants can you please advise Halcol Energy on 5438 8133 to arrange a suitable time.
Halcol Energy are also doing a check of our solar system on the same day, if your need to change the date and time can you please advise them to change ours to the same date as well.

Good Afternoon Craig,

Thank you for your email.

My apologies for not notifying you about the carpet earlier.

Mark from Carpet Court attended and has advised that the section of carpet in question is due to the join wearing over time. There unfortunately is know spare carpet on site that can be used to replace this section. He advised that he trimmed the area for the time being and the only solution for repair would be to replace the carpet in the whole bedroom in the future. 

*** Tash Moores  *** 15/10/2018 3:13:11 PM
Hi Tash,

I hope you’re well.

May I please enquire if you’d had a chance to arrange for some to attend to the issue identified in the September inspection report relating to the carpet? (In order to prevent the issue from becoming any worse).

Kind Regards,

Craig

Good Afternoon Craig,

I hope your week is going well.

Please find attached the photo provided by Mobbs Electrical of the new oven. 

*** Hannah Reed *** 28/09/2018 11:11:44 AM
Hi Tash,

Thank you kindly for confirming the oven has been received and also for arranging with Mobbs Electrical for it to be installed next Tuesday.

I mentioned to Hannah on the phone that some trimming of the upper/lower cabinetry may possibly be required - since the dimensions of the new oven (on paper) show it being a few centimetres taller. Would you mind passing that info onto Mobbs – just so they take the necessary tools when they go out?
 
Alternatively if Mobbs don’t do that type of work then I’m guessing they’ll need to leave the upper/lower panels off and provide the measurements to someone else to trim it to fit accordingly (I guess we cross that bridge when we get to it).

Just one final request Do you think it would be asking too much of Mobbs electrical to request a photo upon completion of the ovens installation?

*** Hannah Reed *** 19/09/2018 11:53:42 AM
Hi Hannah,

Thank you for your call this morning.

Just letting you know that an order has been placed with Whitfords Appliances. Delivery to your office is expected either tomorrow or Friday.

The model to be delivered is a Westinghouse model# WVE615S (perhaps I could ask you just to double-check they’ve delivered the right model before you arrange Mobbs electrical to install it).

I selected this model as it comes with the following features:
- Simple to use
- Fan Forced
- Cool touch door (safer when kids are around)
- Rounded door handle ends (safer when kids are around)
- Fingerprint resistant stainless steel
- Overwhelming positive reviews online
- Australian designed and made (having parts available locally saves having to wait for them to arrive from o/seas)
- 5 year warranty (2 year from manufacturer plus 3 years extension)

Regards,

Craig

to me 
Hi Tash,

I have done some research this evening and picked out an oven, which I intend on purchasing myself.

As the new oven will require installation I will require the services of a licensed electrician. 

I am yet to decide on the retailer that I am going to purchase the oven from, however I wanted to enquire with you whether it’d be better to arrange delivery direct to the property or have the electrical contractor collect it?

If the oven is to be delivered then I’ll need to ask you to check with the tenants when they will be home or alternatively arrange a location (preferably somewhere secure and dry) where the new oven can be left.

If you have some time in the morning would you mind giving me a call to discuss the logistics? 
Kind Regards,
Craig

Hi Pete, (Mobbs) 

re: Invoice 33063

You replaced the element in the oven and kindly whilst on site adjusted the oven door for the tenant as it was not sealing properly.

The tenant's have advised that the door is once again not sealing properly. 

Would you suggest new hinges for the oven, and if so may I please have a price for these to be replaced.

Thanks very much.

Hi Hannah,
Please find attached a copy of the certificate of currency for the insurance on the property.
Legal liability: This policy covers your legal liability when you are found to be legally responsible for damage or personal injury to a third party or their property. It is limited to $20 million in total for all claims arising from any one accident. 
In relation to the termite inspection, the one question I have is will this include an inspection of the roof space? (As the house is built on a concrete slab there is no underfloor inspection able to be carried out).
My preferred company would be "" Suncoast Pest Control - $121 inc GST"" - on the proviso they are willing to agree to inspect the roof space.
Should you require any further information please let me know.

to me 
Hi Hannah,

Thank you for advising me of the tenants response.

If they wish to leave at the end of the lease period then that’s no issue.

Once the tenants have confirmed back in writing their intention not to renew the lease I will ask you to start the advertising for a new tenants (will confirm with you the date of availability).

Of course if the tenants wish to stay on at the current rate of $520- per week and re-sign a 6 or 12 month lease agreement that’s fine also.

In terms of the rental rate for new incoming tenants I’m thinking $530-/wk. If you don’t believe that’s achievable please let me know.

Regards,

Craig

Good Morning Hannah,
I trust you had a nice weekend.
In relation the tenants request for air-conditioning I would be willing to consider the installation of a ducted system which will provide cooling for the entire house, however in return I require;
a.      Agreement in writing from the tenants they will stay for a minimum of 12 months.

b.      An increase in the rent by $20-/week to help offset the cost of installing air-conditioning (based on this nominal increase it’ll still take at least 8 years to off-set the cost of the installation).
Alternatively, if the tenants a not prepared to agree to accept a rent increase, they are welcome to continue to stay, on either a 6 or 12 months lease and the rent will remain unchanged.
Regards,
Craig

Not sure whether you are saying the garage door is broken or that
it needs a new remote control.  We had this door attended to not so

remote control, I will try and replace it but will need details of the door
to do so.

Katrina called and said to go ahead with the termtie inspection 

*** Administrator *** 21/09/2018 2:47:49 PM
Tenant, Cory phoned. He was worried about security at the house when people come through to view. I assured him that we have everyones details for security purposes. He then said that he is not happy paying for marketing every time we do an inspection. I explained that the marketing is a set fee and that we don't charge per inspection. He wanted to know how many people are confirmed for todays inspection and I told him only 1 at this stage which he was not happy about. He said that if that happens again he wants the viewing cancelled as it takes them ages to get the property ready for the inspections, if only one person is coming through its not worth it. He said he would rather just wait until they move out before we do more viewings. I advised him that we need to be showing that we are actively looking for new tenants as they are breaking lease and we are trying to help them, as they will be liable for the outstanding rent until someone new is approved. He said he can see that at this rate he will not get his bond 
He asked if any applications had yet gone in and I told him no. He said if lots of applications go in and the owner declines, then he will stop paying the rent as he can't afford it and he is paying 
his mortgage and rent, and he hasn't been paid for 2 weeks!! I left it with the tenant that we would let them know if anything changed between now and when the inspection is scheduled for later.

Good Morning Guy and Katrina,

I hope your week is going well so far.

Please find below reminder regarding the Termite Inspection and Pest Control which is now due at your property.

Could you please advise if you would like me to arrange for this to be carried out.

Thanks very much.

*** Tash Moores  *** 2/07/2018 2:57:27 PM
Good Afternoon Katrina,

Thank you for your email and I hope yourself and Guy had a lovely weekend.

Thank you for sending through the water bill, I will invoice your tenants for their usage.

In regards to the email regarding the Termite and Building Inspections, this was an email sent  to notify all of our owners that our Agency recommends for Termite and Building Inspections to be carried out annually. 

You are correct in saying that your Termite Inspection is not due until September. Could you please confirm in writing that you are happy for our agency to carry out annual Termite Barrier Inspections and whether or not you would like our agency to carry out Building Inspections.

Also can you please provide us an updated copy of your insurance details for our records for your property. 

Thank you very much and enjoy the rest of your afternoon. 

*** Tash Moores  *** 29/06/2018 2:57:13 PM
Hi

I have just remembered about the water rates for the property.  Please find the invoice attached and bill the tennants accordingly.

Also there was an email we received a few weeks ago regarding  termite and building inspection.  Was this just advertising as I don't think ours is due until September?
  
Regards

Hi,
I Just wanted to let you know I'm not happy that I have workers letting themselves onto our property without mine or corey's consent. We have a right to privacy. I feel very invaded. I'm heavily pregnant and was up all night keeping an eye on my son after he had a head injury yesterday so I was having nap while my children were also until I was woken by people walking down the side of our house. I must say I'm shocked to say the least. When I received a call from unknown number I sent a message letting them know I'd call back soon. 
I hope you can have this matter sorted out. And have these people off our property until further notice. Also the man that was here to fix the aircon last Tuesday said he couldn't do it because there was a chance of rain and he also needed inside access. So I'm not sure how they can be fixing the aircon in the rain right now without inside access.

Good afternoon Ajex, 

I hope all is well with you. 

I have followed up with Plantation Homes regarding the roof patio leak and unfortunately they are not going to be covering this cost under their warranty period. 

They advised that they found a cracked tile along the ridge line above the patio area, and as it has been 3 years since hand over they will not cover the costs to have this fixed. 

Would you like me to arrange a quote to have the tile repaired and patio ceiling repaired? Alternatively you may which to claim this under your insurance? 

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me.

It appears that the blown bulb body is fused to the metal it was screwed into, and I'm not able to get it off at all. I don't think I can use the oven now, because I can't leave the bulb casing exposed ?? .....Help! 

*** Tash Moores  *** 12/10/2018 3:41:24 PM
Hi Tash,
The oven bulb is a screw type and should unscrew in the normal way. I have replaced it several times over the years and I think we left a spare buld for the tenant. Nicole could try wriggling it a little with a little bit of inward pressure while turning as the bulbs are quite strong and I have never broken one. Turn the oven switch off at the wall first.
Failing that we are happy for you to get a
 Handyman to replace the bulb.

Hi Tash,

I was changing the light bulb between the kitchen and bar yesterday, and when I tested the light, the safety switch tripped and I was unable to reset it. We had no lights or fans functioning throughout the house, so I had to call the electrician. He came out, isolated the problem, which was the fan in the kitchen, and removed it because it was faulty. He  has taken it away, so we currently have no lighting or fan in that area.

This morning when I opened the dishwasher to empty it, the upper stainless steel arm was sitting in the lower dish area. After much effort, I am unable to get it back on. ?? Could I please have these fixed asap, along with my towel rack and toilet roll holder! Thank you.

Hi Lisa,

Thank you for your email.

My apologies for my late response, I have returned to work today after having Monday and Tuesday off with my little boy who is very unwell. 

Please find attached the photo's I took on Friday of the Laundry door. 

I did not offer the tenants their lease renewal as I was not happy with the laundry door, the bottom of the door requires to be planed off as it is catching and is hard to open and close, the front of the door is not painted, the back of the door is painted the wrong colour, and the cut out for where they have attached the hinge's is way to large and un-even.

Could you please let me know how you would like me to proceed - 

1. Give the tenants 7 Days to have the door back to a professional standard

2. Issue the tenants with a Remedy Breach notice (This would still give them 7 Days to have the door back to a professional standard)

3. Not offer the tenants the lease renewal and issue them with a notice to leave (This would require giving them 2 months notice)

Thank you very much.",2023-02-20,S339,13,weekly,6,weekly,|AA - Routine Frequency Audit||Charge Advertising||Complies with 2022 Smoke Alarm Legislation||Excite Smoke Alarms||Lease Renewal Fee|,true,false,2018-12-02T23:48:47.0000000Z,2022-11-26T16:38:08.0000000Z,ac750197-91d8-42ab-aae8-59f52d0d0747,a98904c7-99da-4fd8-ac77-f220881f1129

Good Afternoon Robert & Melinda,

I hope you both have been well.

I have received a request from the tenants to have an Air Conditioner installed, please see below email:

Good afternoon,

We were wondering if the owners of 30 Ochre Crescent would kindly consider installing an aircon for the living / dining / kitchen area? With summer fast approaching we are already feeling the heat somewhat.

Their consideration and investment would be most appreciated.

Kind regards,

Justin Lippiatt

Could you please advise if you would be happy for me to obtain quotes for your perusal.

Thank you very much.

So that I can purchase the correct length curtain rod.  Could you please ask the tenants what the size of the door is that needs to be covered.  Just the width is fine.

The tenant Vanessa came by the office this afternoon, following up in regards to the curtain. She said the air conditioner struggles to keep the house cool with the heat beaming through the glass sliding door without any curtains.

Could you please let me know a suitable day and time for Shane to go by if you wish to install curtains?

Thanks so very much, I look forward to hearing from you.

Have a lovely afternoon.

Hi there Kylie,

Thank you for your email. 

The tenant Vanessa was hoping if possible if Shane could come by in the afternoon (as she works split shifts and sleeps during the day) from Wednesday to Friday next week, or if he could alternatively come by the following week on Monday or Tuesday as she is home all day those two days.

I hope this is suitable for you too.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Have a great day.

*** Emily Brauner *** 22/10/2018 4:07:53 PM
I'm sorry, I had actually forgotten about that.  I will arrange this for when Shane is home again next week.  From the Wednesday onwards.  I'll let you know what day so that you can provide 24 hours notice to the tenants.


Kind regards,


Kylie

Good afternoon Kylie and Shane,

I hope you're well and had a great weekend.

The tenant Vanessa has contacted me to follow up regarding whether you have decided if you would like to install a curtain on the glass sliding door as requested at the routine inspection?

Thanks so much.

Good afternoon Pradeep,

When I spoke with Nick regarding the acceptance of the new tenancy, he informed me there is a third applicant Mitchell who wishes to be approved to live at the property, who had not handed in his tenancy application form with the two other applicants. When I queried whether Mitchell already resided at the property, Nick confirmed he also did too, which had not been mentioned or explained at the recent routine. I advised Nick we urgently required his application form to process to pass on for your consideration. My sincere apologies for the miscommunication.

We recently received his application and have begun processing.

Please see below tenancy application for your consideration.


Mitchell Baker, aged 31
No dependents 
One pet, a Arab x Mastiff dog, aged 7

Mitchell works as a Maintenance Hand for Protech in Maroochydore for over the past 3 years. He earns an average of $1,000 to $1,300 per week. We are waiting on a return call from his employer to confirm his stability and earnings.

He advised he has lived at Amber Drive for the past 6 or so months, contributing to the weekly rent of $430. He was not home at the recent routine.

Prior, Mitchell lived in Caloundra along Caloundra Road for 12 months. 

Tenancy database check through TICA has come back good for Mitchell. Unfortunately, National Tenancy Database was down and I was unable to conduct the tenancy search. I will check again tomorrow and complete the check.


If you have any questions regarding the above, please do not hesitate to contact me on 07 5438 0090.

*** Emily Brauner *** 4/10/2018 12:50:30 PM
Good afternoon Pradeep,

Thank you so much for your prompt response.

I will give Nick and Samuel a call let them know the good news.

I have also sent through a work order to our handyman Ron at All Done Services to fix the door latch.

Have a lovely afternoon.

*** Emily Brauner *** 4/10/2018 12:33:02 PM
Yes, please go ahead with the handyman to fix the latch and also the new tenancy application.

Thanks,

Are you able to please send me a photo copy of the rates for the property we are renting?  We’ve been getting excessive electricity bills, and have only just worked out with AGL that the property was registered as a commercial property when being built.

Kindly,

Good Afternoon Tracey,

My apologies for my late response, I hope you had a lovely weekend.

The tenant's did advise that they would like to stay, however they have not returned their signed lease agreement as yet.

Also I have received a price for the replacement on/off button on the dishwasher. The cost of the part is  $176 + GST including labour. Please note that if there is a separate issue with the dishwasher this would be an added cost. 

?I would also be happy to obtain a price for a new dishwasher if you would like to consider that option. 

Could you please let me know your thoughts at your earliest convenience, thank you very much. ?

Just a quick email to let you know that the hot water circuit breaker has tripped out at our rental at 39 Apple Cresent, Caloundra West. It has tripped out around 5 or so times in the last couple of months. Once reset it stays on for a week or so then trips out again. Its not urgent but it may pay to call an electrician to see if they think this should happen randomly or not. 

Let me know if you require any further on this?

Hello Shane and Kylie,

Great news! Your tenant has signed and returned the lease renewal. Please find attached copy for your records.

Our records also indicate that you would like to complete the smoke alarm testings yourself for your property. Please find attached owner smoke alarm testing checklist and other information relating to smoke alarms and blinds.

As per legislation, the testings need to be completed within 30 days prior to the new lease commencing. 

Could you please kindly advise when you would like to access the property, preferably over the next week if possible and we can issue your tenant with an entry notice.

Hope you both have a lovely weekend.

I just had a call from Damien of Peter Sadler Associates. Can you please call back to organise entry to Crater Street, Caloundra for a depreciation assessment. 1800 147 747.

*** Hannah Reed *** 9/05/2018 1:08:31 PM
Hi 
So I called the manufacturer and they sent out a technician who has fixed the issue. The issue is the installation with the plumbing. He had to cut the pipping hole out as it wasn’t cut out correctly making the water draining only being drained through a very small hole in the plumbing under the sink. This was also making the water leak as the dishwasher hose wasn’t correctly positioned on the plumbing it was missing a piece to connect it to the plumbing. 
He has invoiced me $110 via email which hasn’t come through yet. I will send it through ASAP. 
Due to the issue being incorrect plumbing installation I will be asking for the owners to please pay the invoice.

Regards Amanda Latham

Good Afternoon Muhammad and Niha,

I hope you both had a lovely weekend.

The new tenants would like to request that an Air Conditioner be installed in the living area and the main bedroom of the property.

As this was discussed with the previous tenancy I have informed the tenants that we would require to mutually end their current agreement and then increase their rent from $400.00 per week to $420.00 per week for a 12 month term if you would like to proceed with the installations.

I have contacted Tenmen Electrical and asked them if the quotation that you selected for the Air Conditioning was still valid, they have notified me that yes it is and the price would still be the same. (please see attached)

Could you please let me know your thoughts at your earliest convenience, thank you.

Hi Hannah,
Thank-you for your email.
Can you please check with the Tenants if the lever on the right-hand side of the house is pushed down, this is located in a Green box. This must be pushed down for the water to enter the water tank.
In regard to the flooding in the back yard a lot of the surround houses are a lot higher so unfortunately with all this rain we are getting it flows down to lower ground.

It has rained  all weekend and although i can see other tanks on properties  around me fillling with run off there has been no water into my tanks. There seams to be a blockage and I have not had access to rain water since i have been in the property.

Good Afternoon Elizabeth & Bruce,

I hope you both are having a lovely week so far.

I have received an email from the tenant of your property regarding the Main Bathroom Toilet, the toilet in consistently running as the float internally is not registering that it is full. 

Caitlin currently has the toilet turned off at the wall.

Would you be happy for me to arrange our plumber to attend and repair the toilet?

Also Caitlin your tenant would like to request a front security door, she would really appreciate this for security for her 2 little girls and also so she can have the front door open to let the beautiful breeze through the house and not have to worry about her little girls.

Could you please let me know if you would like me to obtain a quote for the front screen door for your perusal.

Thank you very much.

Hello team!

Could you please let our tenant, Karen, know that we have put in a request with SCC for a tree on the nature strip out the front.

We have asked for the whole area to be mulched, but they may or may not agree to this.

They said it may take a fair while to happen....it is council.....

Karen has planted some Marigolds and more Dietes in front of the letter box, which looks lovely!

The Dietes and Dianellas I planted will survive I think, but may take some time to establish themselves. They are pretty hardy.

Thank you.

Cheers, Rosalind. 8-)

*** Tash Moores  *** 31/10/2018 1:42:57 PM
Could you please inform the tenant of the following.

We have renovated the landscaping at the front of the house and there are new plants. There is an automatic sprinkler on the main area which is set to come on at 6 pm for ½ hour on Tue, Thur & Fri for the time being.

The 2 small areas of garden beside & in front of the bin surround also have new plants which will need to be watered manually. There is a hose coiled up in the bin surround for this purpose. Could the tenant please water the new plants in these areas twice a week for 5 to 10 minutes. 

To turn that hose on:
Leave tap as it is. There is a two-way fitting below the tap. Turn on the left side by moving the lever to direction of flow. Turn off when finished by moving lever to 90 degrees.

That hose is covered by shallow mulch. Karen is not to worry if hose becomes uncovered while watering. We will make a more permanent arrangement later.

There is still lawn on the verge outside the footpath which will need to be mowed. This area is under control of council & we are not allowed to change it. We will be requesting council to put in a tree & mulch there. Fingers crossed! 

Regards

Thank you very much for your email and we will continue with All Pest QLD when it is due coming up in October. 
Thank you also for a copy of your updated insurance policy on your property. 
I have spoken with Karen your tenant and she said that would be wonderful if you wanted to create a garden like the neighbour next door. Karen said she would prefer that then the grass that is their currently. 
I hope you have a wonderful weekend.

Hello Team!:-)

Thank you for your email re insurance and termite inspections.
I have attached the paid insurance invoices as requested.
Previously we used All Pest QLD to do our termite inspection and report, so it would make sense to continue with them when our inspection comes due.
Thanks for all you do for our property.
I did notice that the house next to ours has done their garden and it looks awesome!! We would be happy if they wanted to extend their garden onto our front area, as long as our tenant, Karen Bechley, is happy about it. 
Could you please ask her when next see her? If she is happy with the idea, Cameron and I could approach the neighbours and talk  to them and see if they would be interested.

Good Afternoon Vinu & Priyadarsini,
I hope you both are having a lovely week.
I have received an email from the tenants requesting that the 2 x brackets for the curtain rod in the main bedroom be replaced as they have unfortunately broken.  
Also the tenant has advised that the hot water system is still consistently beeping.
Can you please let me know if you would like me to arrange a time with the tenants for you to replace the 2 brackets and to have a look at the hot water system. 
Thank you very much. ",2023-02-01,S444,13,weekly,6,weekly,|AA - Routine Frequency Audit||Complies with 2022 Smoke Alarm Legislation||NOT ALLMAX|,true,false,2018-12-02T23:51:57.0000000Z,2022-11-27T12:30:21.0000000Z,ac7501a5-013d-4b7c-bc17-3677b6ba0247,a98904c7-99da-4fd8-ac77-f220881f1129

Good afternoon Shielo, 

Thank you very much for your email regarding 6 Allpass Court, Baringa. 

Please find below list from the tenant so far: 

- blind in the kitchen/dining area does not budge
- hotplate was incorrectly fitted, not compliant with installation procedure, therefore it has a chip from something on it.
- The smoke alarms may require attention as they continue to go off at random times day and night. 
- Main toilet door is hard to open at times - seems to swell with the weather?

Tenants contact details for access: Sarah - 0466 645 813

Thanks so much 

*** Administrator *** 20/11/2018 10:47:38 AM
Smoke alarms all went off again 19/11/18
Hey Sarah,

Mick spoke to the tenants last night and told her the hush and power down sequence so she can get the alarm to stop. The tenant was all good so everything is a-ok ??
Kind Regards,
  Tehgan Hill

*** Hannah Reed *** 30/08/2018 12:58:07 PM
Good afternoon, 
This morning just after 2am all of the smoke alarms went off without reason?
To disable them, we had to remove the batteries to silent the beep following after the alarm had been stopped.
Please could it be organized to have someone come to above address to rectify.
Thanking you kindly

Thank you and have a great day!  :)

Should you have any questions, please let me know.

Good morning Shielo,

Thank you for your time on the phone this morning.

As discussed, your maintenance technician is going out on Monday to attend to the front door.

- The media room left hand side door bangs against the door frame at the top, gets stuck and does not shut whereas the right hand side door clips in place and lies flush with the frame
- Door stop piece on ensuite floor loose
- Toilet roll holder in ensuite loose

We do have new tenants moving in on Saturday and we have sent them an entry notice for Monday.

Thank you.

*** Emily Brauner *** 30/11/2018 9:41:53 AM
Hello Michael,

Thank you for your email.

I have called and spoken with Integrale Homes. Shielo the maintenance coordinator has asked us to send through a list of the items and they will advise if this is something they will be able to attend to under warranty or not.

I will keep you updated.

If you have any questions or would like to discuss further, please do not hesitate to contact me.

*** Emily Brauner *** 29/11/2018 11:19:37 AM
Good morning Michael and Kylie,

I hope you're well and having a great day.

The exit inspection has been conducted and completed at your property along Rosseau in Aura.

We are sending the bond cleaners back to attend to some minor items, such as bugs in light covers, window and door tracks, etc.

The tenants have attempted to patch and paint some small dents however unfortunately they were not quite to a professional standard. They have agreed for us to engage a professional painter and he will be going by tomorrow to rectify.

There was a few maintenance items noticed that do require your attention.

- The media room left hand side door bangs against the door frame at the top, gets stuck and does not shut whereas the right hand side door clips in place and lies flush with the frame
- Door stop piece on ensuite floor loose
- Toilet roll holder in ensuite loose

Please let me know if you would like us to arrange a handyman to attend.

If you have any questions or would like to discuss further, please do not hesitate to contact me on 07 5438 0090.

*** Hannah Reed *** 10/04/2018 10:11:56 AM
Good morning Shielo, 

I hope you are having a great week so far. 

We have the electrician going to 6 Rosseau Street next week - can you please also add in for him to replace the smoke alarm. It was mentioned that the 6 month maintenance however the tenant was going to replace the battery to see if this would help however it is still going off. 

Please see below email from tenant. 

Thank you very much. 

""Hi Hannah
We have come to believe that the smoke alarms may be faulty. We've replaced the battery but they keep going off randomly similar to what was happening when we 1st moved and and had 1 replaced. Might be worth getting a sparky to come and replace them."" 

*** Administrator *** 22/03/2018 3:56:52 PM
Hi Michael,
We have been advised by our landscaper that your maintenance issue with the extra yard gully has been completed.

This job has now been marked as completed & the request has now been closed off in our system. 

The landscaper believes that the water pooling has been caused by the neigbouring house in the LHS.

We will close this off for now but if the same issue occurs in the coming days, please let us know.

We are still on the look of completing the other outstanding issues noted at your property.


Ensuite – no seal on the shower doors – my maintenance supervisor will attend to this upon his return next week
Bed 3 – fan switch faulty (very hard to turn) – a warranty claim has been raised to the supplier.
Water pump – a service request has been sent to the plumber and this has been followed up.
 

I will let you know and keep you posted for any development on the issues.


Thank you and have a great day!  ??

 

Should you have any questions, please let me know.

 

Kind Regards,

Shielo Quiñones

Hello Michael,

I hope your week is going well. 

I received an email from your tenants, regarding the NBN internet connection, as they setting up the internet and phone. NBN are now charging any brand new connection a $300 fee.

There is no legal obligation for you as the owner to pay the full amount, however in most cases the owner agrees to pay or negotiates with the tenant to pay half the cost. Particularly, as the NBN boxes would then remain at the property once the tenant vacates for the next tenants to use. 

Please let me know your thoughts on the above and if you have any questions. 

Look forward to hearing from you.

*** Emily Brauner *** 12/09/2018 3:46:10 PM
Hi Emily,
Thank you for the e-mail. 
As we discussed earlier, could you please ask the owner of the property to cover the NBN connection charge $300 as it is going to be the part of the property forever.

Thanks Hannah.

You would have to be one of the most politest people I have ever met! 

The rent payment was made last night too. 

Stockland have pushed out the settlement date on our land to March to May 2019 so if it is ok with the owners, we will have to extend the rental agreement again at some point.

We have held off on running the new waste line for the moment as our serviceman has noticed that the pool chlorinator is not functioning.
 
A quote to repair will cost $88.00 plus parts, but we won’t know the total until we have had approval to remove and inspect.

Hi Zoie
Garry cut the umbrella tree down this morning and will go back and poison in the near future . He also noticed the gutters need cleaning out so he will do that when he goes back .
Also I was going to call , but I noticed the amount the gets deposited varies quite a bit from month to month for both properties .
I imagine its due to a five week month sometimes but even so it still seems to be a mixed bag .
Can you explain this in an email ?
Thanks Jo

HI Emily


Thank you - ok - it might not ""look the best"" but as I mentioned yesterday we do have a small amount of funds put aside for the rental property (for maintenance items) - and as this is not a maintenance item I have to limit what we can spend.


So although it might not ""look the best"" can we do this.


Get the screens for Bed 1 as this is at the front of the house, and then have the two bedrooms that the girls sleep in done. The 4th bedroom and media room can wait - and maybe get these done in the new year?


Many Thanks

Lyndall

Good afternoon Lyndall,

I have spoken with Sam from Supaview regarding the quote. 

Bed 1 - $375.00
Bed 2 - $120.00
Bed 3 - $120.00
Bed 4 - $120.00
Media - $135.00

Total: $870.00

He apologised, he accidentally left out the fourth bedroom from the quote.

He is more than happy for payment to be received after installation with no deposit required as it will be paid from the rental monies via our trust account.

I look forward to hearing from you and your thoughts regarding the above.

Have a lovely afternoon.

That's a shame they are leaving so quick!
I'll take your recommendation on managing their exit.  I guess the most important thing is to secure new tenants before Christmas.

Good evening Paul,

Hope you've had a great week.

I just wanted to let you know no one came by our office to pick up the faulty safety switch.

We are open tomorrow 9am to 12pm if one of your reps happens to be in the area. 

Thank you so very much,

Good morning Paul,

That would be great, Friday would be perfect. We are open from 8:30am to 5:00pm.

Warm regards,

Hi Hannah,

Thanks for your follow up call and apologies for the delay I have been interstate training for the past 3 days.

I have confirmed one of our representatives will be in the area on Friday morning to collect the breaker.

If suitable, are you able to confirm what time the office will be open so the breaker can be collected please?

Kind Regards

Hi Hannah,
I have received the attached Invoice for Service Work completed at Lot 1439 (8) Stone Crescent, Bells Creek.
When reviewing the Invoice I note the correct Warranty Claim process has not been followed resulting in a non-Clipsal by Schneider Electric Service Agent completing the work.
However, as Bold Properties are a valued Building Partner of Clipsal by Schneider Electric we are more than happy to address this retrospectively.
To do so a Product Fault Investigation will need to be conducted on the faulty breaker to determine the cause of the failure.
If the fault found proves to be a manufacturing fault the cost of the Service Visit and replacement breaker will be covered by Clipsal by Schneider Electric.
However, if the fault found is otherwise the cost will need to be covered by Positive Property People.
To proceed are you able to retrieve the faulty breaker and advise a suitable pick up address please?
Also, for future reference I have attached the Standard Clipsal by Schneider Electric Warranty Claim process.
I trust this is an acceptable resolution, however please do not hesitate to let me know if any additional information or assistance is required.

Kind Regards
Paul McFeeters

Hi Hannah,
Thank you for your email regarding the faulty safety switch.
After liaising with our electricians and construction team we have had to go back to the manufacture directly (Clipsal).
I have finally been able to receive their representative details and I am currently following an update on the warranty procedure regarding a faulty safety switch.
I will be in contact with you later this week to advise further information and how we continue from here.
Kind Regards,

Good morning Tash ??
The property you manage at  80 Creekwood Ave, Meridan Plains, has a Trithor Physical Barrier installed. Unfortunately as the installing company, we have not been appointed to complete annual termite inspections, there is no longer a warranty associated.   We can however provide you with a free service period warranty, provided there are no active termites at the property and all recommendations are adhered to.  Free Service Period Warranty covers treatment of active termites within the property only, no timber replacement.
Please let me know if you would like to make a booking.

Hi Tash, 

I'm just confirming that I will go ahead with getting the damage repaired that was caused by the dishwasher. A few weeks ago you provided me with two quotes with different amounts and work, which I have attached to this email. I will proceed with the first option that has the quoted amount of $489.50. 
I'm still researching dishwashers, but I figure the damage to the dishwasher area needs to be repaired first, before a new dishwasher is installed. 

Kind regards, 
Angela.

Good Afternoon Angela,

Please find below findings and photo's received from Mobbs Electrical - 

 
""Please see following regarding dishwasher

Attend to diagnose fault for water leak in kitchen, found dishwasher to be the main cause of the damage, this has probably been leaking slowly from the first day it was installed.
Pulled apart the dishwasher to find the leak. Found signs of rust and water damage, pulled apart drain pump to find that there was a fault in the connection which would have over time leaked water. 
Owner will need to send email of report and all photos to Electrolux to see if they will cover anything due to being out of warranty.

Could you also please send me updated information about the dishwasher. I received information on September 28th that your team was organising for a dishwasher technician to come out and assess the problem. However, I have heard no more information since then. I would like this problem to be fixed ASAP as it is leaking water and causing more damage to the wall and carpet. Any information would be greatly appreciated.

Hi Angela, 

Of course, the dishwasher is Dishlex brand, so you would need to contact Electrolux.

Please find below warranty information from their website.

Warranty FOR SALES IN AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND APPLIANCE: DISHLEX DISHWASHERS 

Warranty Period: Subject to these terms and conditions, this warranty continues for in Australia for a period of 24 months and in New Zealand for a period of 24 months, following the date of original purchase of the Appliance. 

I hope you have a great afternoon.

Hi Tash, 

Can I get the company name of the dishwasher manufacturer? I'm a bit skeptical that a dishwasher should breakdown after only a few years. I would like to give the dishwasher company a call just to find out my options as this is quite an issue that it is leaking and has now caused damage. 

Kind regards, 

*** Tash Moores  *** 5/09/2018 1:16:08 PM
Good Afternoon Angela,

Thank you so much for your email, my apologies for my delayed response I have been trying to obtain answers from Vantage Homes and it was also quite difficult to get access to the property due to the tenants work situation. 

I attended the property with the plumber from Vantage Homes.

It was found that there was a slow leak at the back of the dishwasher causing the walls behind the dishwasher to swell and the skirting running behind the kitchen and in the walk in robe, please see attached photo of the damage behind the dishwasher. 

The dishwasher water did not run onto the floor in front of the dishwasher so there has been know evidence to the tenants of a leak until they notice the swelling in the walk in wardrobe.  

Vantage Homes have advised that the supervisor is re attending on Monday and will notify me if the repairs will be covered under warranty. 

The dishwasher however is out of the warranty period, would you like me to obtain a quote for repair of the dishwasher? It may be more cost officiant to replace with a new dishwasher which I am happy to obtain a price for also.

Thank you very much and I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.

Hi Hannah,
As discussed, the best way to get rid of the air con water would be to run it into the stormwater and put mechanisms in place to ensure the aircon pipe won't easily block and is easily accessible and identifiable. The cost for this is $203.75 inc GST materials and labour.
Let me know if you have any problems or if the owners would like to proceed.

It would be $1089 inc GST to supply and install a smaller pump that would be sufficient for lawns and gardens only.  
 
Let me know if you have any problems. 

Kind Regards,

Thank you for your email. 
Have you noticed any lawn grub nests on the patio ceiling? This can be an indication that there are lawn grubs which can be treated with spray. I do know that is has been so dry, and may be best to monitor this and see what happens to the area after all this rain. 
I have followed up with Showerarma, and they have advised me that they will be making contact with you this week to come out and repair. 
If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me.

Good morning Ibrahim,

I have noted this morning the email from Sarah Cooney of Devcon re the outstanding payment for the acoustic requirements as detailed in your land contract. I understand that this special condition required by council for this site was overlooked by Nadia when she perused and advised you on your land contract.  Therefore she has now agreed to pay for this additional amount!  This has not yet occurred.  You have mentioned that this will be covered by her Insurance Scheme, however Devcon will not accept this extended payment timeframe.  However, they have not yet responded regarding this, but I am waiting on an email from Sarah Cooney of Devcon to clarify this. Handover was to be Monday next at 10am, however they have extended it now to Thursday the 5th July at 10am.  This is due to this outstanding payment, and to allow time for Nadia to make this payment to yourself or Devcon. She can then begin the prolonged process of claiming on her insurance. 

Ibrahim,

Your build has gone overtime anyway and I do not want anything else to extend this – we are just ready to get it into the market for you and earn you some income!  And now this has occurred.

 

Please could you discuss the above with Nadia as a matter of urgency – and then advise me when this payment will be made so that I can then confirm handover with Megan and Hannah. 

 

Many thanks

Kaye

Hi Tash,

Thanks for the routine report,all looks well,thanks.

Regarding the tenants requests,for toilet,oven,shower,please go ahead as you have advised.

I now see the extent of the bird problem, hopefully once they’re gone we can knock the nest down,would there be any way to further discourage them?I here they come back to the same

Place every year once they settle in.

Thanks again Mike

The termite inspection is now due & the cost will be $165. As this property is a duplex we would be happy to keep the price the same, but we would need to guarantee access to both sides of the duplex in the same appointment. 

If you have any questions, please contact our office or if the owners would like to go ahead, please send all Work Orders to info@accuratepest.com.au .

Hi ladies,

I've had some dramas with the side gate as it has come away from the wall, it has been pretty dodgy from the beginning as it was never even with the other side and would open from the latch if we had a lot of wind so gave got a heap of bricks holding it together the best I can but will need it fixed real soon so the dogs don't get out. I've attached photos for you. Thanks

Good afternoon Harsha,

I hope you have been well.

I was wondering if you have had a chance to read through my below email.

Would you be happy for me to proceed with engaging our handyman to repair the kitchen blind and spray the kikuyu grass in the drain area?

Also are you happy for the tenants to proceed with their request to remove the dead plants from the front garden and re-bark the garden?

Thank you very much.

Good Morning Harsha,

I hope you had a lovely weekend.

I have received an email from your tenants requesting that the kitchen blind be repaired, the blind is rolling up un-evenly and getting stuck. 

Would you be happy for me to arrange our Handyman to attend and re-roll the blind onto the bar at the top of the blind?

Also your tenants have requested permission to remove the dead plants in the front garden and re bark the garden at their expense to try and reduce the problem they are having with kikuyu grass that is strangling the plants. They have tried poison on several occasions, unfortunately the grass continues to grow back through. 

This grass is also making its way into the roadside drain and blocking the drain causing the back yard to be constantly wet, I have contacted Sunshine Coast Council regarding this issue who have advised me this area is the owners responsibility due to the drain being a storm water drain. 

Would you like me to arrange for the kikuyu grass to be sprayed in the drain area? 

Thank you very much.

Hi Tash,
Can you advise the tenant please have a look at filter as its commonly clogged and stops it often stops dishwashers working.
It’s a simple maintenance item they are expected to do.
Also can they check the switch in the meter box has not flicked off ?
Yours faithfully,

Paul Festa

Good Afternoon Loredana & Paul,

I hope you both are having a lovely week so far.

I was wondering if you have had a chance to read through the routine inspection report attached.

The tenant has reported the dishwasher is know longer working, could you please advise if you would be happy for me to arrange our electrician to attend and diagnose the dishwasher as the dishwasher would now be not covered by warranty.  This would be at a cost of $88.00 + GST.

I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience, thank you very much.

Good Afternoon Barry,

I hope you had a great weekend.

Please see attached photo's taken at the most recent inspection at 1/56 Wilderness Circuit.

I am concerned about the amount of large cracks that are occurring both inside and outside of the property.

I have also engaged our handyman in June to adjust all the internal wood and glass doors on the left hand side of the property due to the doors know longer aligning.

I would appreciate you inspecting the property as this seems to be a structural issue.

I hope you have had a great week so far.

I have received a repair request from the tenants regarding the kitchen tap. 

They have reported that the tap is loose and is unable to be tightened. The tap is not leaking.

Would you like me to monitor the tap and would you like me to arrange for this to possibly be tightened/replaced?

Hi Emil,
Further to our conversation, the sewer manhole in the driveway of 60 Wilderness Circuit, Little Mountain has not been raised in accordance with Unitywater standards (refer attached photo).

As a result, the manhole will need to be rectified and raised in accordance with Unitywater standards as it is a potential safety hazard.  Fraser Properties are in the process of organising Unitywater to undertake these works (cost to be borne by Fraser Properties).

Can you please inform the tenants that these works will be scheduled in the near future and I’ll let you know the date once it has been organised.

If you could send through any specifications you have for the driveway for forwarding to Unitywater it would be appreciated.

Should you have any queries please do not hesitate to contact me.

Hi Hannah, 
I have received confirmation today that flashings etc and other materials were delivered to the property today. 
It would seem that this job will be done very soon. 
Could you please ask the tenants to be diligent in watching the gear supplied and if in an exposed location could they please move so that theft would not occur. 
No doubt you will be notified to organise  entry for repair. 
Many thanks

Good Morning Monica,

I would also like to recommend before replacing the external surround of the garage door that you urgently have a Termite Inspection carried out at the property. 

I hope you have a great afternoon. 


*** Tash Moores  *** 15/08/2018 11:35:29 AM
Hi Tash

This is well outside the maintenance period.

Looking at the photo , was the termite inspection done each year? I would definitely have it checked before you have the jambs replaced.

Regards

Hi Monica,

The builders structural warranty is for 7 years, the garage door surround falls under owner's maintenance for the general wear and tear of the property. 

Have a lovely afternoon. 

*** Tash Moores  *** 13/08/2018 3:57:59 PM
Hi Tash,
Did the builders provide you with that information? The builder’s warranty should cover 7 years which is what I recall when signing the contract.
Please let me know, thank you.

Monica

Good evening Tash,
Thank you for sending through the inspection report. 
In relation to the timber framing surrounding the garage door, considering the house is still under warranty, can I please request you get in touch with the builders of the house and have them rectify this issue?
The builders are 'Devcon Building Co' - can you please follow this up with them as soon as possible to prevent the timber deterioration from worsening?
Please keep me posted with this, thank you.
Kind RegardsMonica

I hope you are well.

I have received a phone call from the tenant reporting the oven is not heating. 

Sam the tenant is currently using the oven and after being on for an hour it has not heated up.

As Mobbs Electrical replaced the element in August I have asked them to attend this afternoon and inspect the oven. 

From what Sam has described it sounds like the element, however unfortunately if this is not this issue Mobbs will charge a call out fee and advise what the problem is.

CAlled owner and spoke with Kaylene and advised her that the teannt will be breaking her lease as she needs to move for work. 
Kaylene also confirmed that they had arranged a valuation on the property and I informed her it was 9am on Wednesday

Hi Zoie
Thanks for the update and truly sorry for inconvenient to the Tenants. We have contacted Hometree who we brought the property thru to see if they can help and get some action quicker. We have asked Donna from Hometree to keep you updated with the progress.
Hopefully this can be resolved in a short space of time.
Are the Tenants ok?
 
 
Regards
Kaylene and Mike Meisinger

Hi Hannah,
Hope you had a great weekend!
I wanted to ask if the owner would mind me having visits from my dogs during some days when I am home? I wanted them to start getting ready for bubs arrival as I would love for them to be a part of bubs life. They would only ever be here if I was here at the house. And obviously if they did anything I would fix it straight away. Ones 9 years old and ones 10 years old.

Also I wanted to ask if the owner was doing anything about the side fence that’s falling down? Just don’t want it to ever fall over on my car. It’s not obviously going to fall now but one day it might and I just wanted to make sure the owner is aware that it will most probably need to be fixed in the future.

Thank you so much for your time.
Have a lovely day!

Hi Emil,
Further to our conversation, the sewer manhole in the driveway of 60 Wilderness Circuit, Little Mountain has not been raised in accordance with Unitywater standards (refer attached photo).

As a result, the manhole will need to be rectified and raised in accordance with Unitywater standards as it is a potential safety hazard.  Fraser Properties are in the process of organising Unitywater to undertake these works (cost to be borne by Fraser Properties).

Can you please inform the tenants that these works will be scheduled in the near future and I’ll let you know the date once it has been organised.

If you could send through any specifications you have for the driveway for forwarding to Unitywater it would be appreciated.

Should you have any queries please do not hesitate to contact me.

Hi Ann , 
The pics tell the story . Dark grey paint finish with no overhead protection,  heat sucked in due to the colour which distorts the core and breaks down the paint fibres and rain has been penetrating the glass openings for quite a while by the look of it . Lack of maintenance also a factor . 
If they purchase a replacement door things need to be addressed. 
Paint in a light reflective colour , fit an overhead awning as per our installation instructions. 
Hope that helps you out. Thanks again. Glenn

Good afternoon Anne, 
I was speaking with Sam this afternoon regarding a warranty on a front door which was purchased through Devcon building group. 
Devcon mentioned that the manufacturer has a 5 year warranty on the front doors. 
I have attached some photos of the door and the issue that it is having to see if we can get this replaced. 
Thanks so much

Hi Hannah

Our maintenance on this dwelling finished on 31/8/16.

However I checked & the warranty on Hume’s entrance doors is 5 years.

If you contact Stacks Building Supplies, who supplied the door, the owner should have a claim from the manufacturer.
Good Luck

Good morning John,

I hope you're having a great week.

Seth from Mister Locksmith has provided an approximate quote for the six doors/screen doors at your property. He advised it would be approximately $300 to $350 to change the barrels in the locks depending on how many were double or single locks.

As advised it is not a legislative requirement and it is therefore entirely up to you if you would like to change the locks or leave as is.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Thanks so very much.

Hello Hannah

As per our phone conversation yesterday, please find below the contact details for us whilst we are away and also for the Brisbane contact whilst we are out of the country.

We can be reached by email from the 19th December to 9th January on halesgoneos@hotmail.com  or via text message only on 0403 502 462.

Greg’s father, Barry Hale is the Brisbane contact if you needed to speak to some one in our absence, his contacts are 07 3325 4892 or mobile 0403 509 780.

I trust that our tenants have been advised that they are not at any time permitted to park either of their cars in the visitors car parks and will cease doing this.

The building will begin to be washed and painted from the 8th January so please ensure they remove everything from their balcony and ensure that their windows are securely closed from this date onwards.
I will advise as soon as I know when their unit door will be painted as the painters will need access to the unit and it will be necessary to leave the door ajar whilst it is drying.

Lastly, I would like to be present at the next Unit Inspection after our return, if you are able to advise when this would likely to be so I can make myself available that would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your help this year, hope you and all of your families enjoy the Christmas and New Year Festivities.

Kind Regards
Karen & Greg Hale

Hey Ladies,

Steve phoned to say that the same leak is still happening in the toilet and that he has spoken to the plumber who is coming out to look at it again.  Steve just wanted to let us know.

*** Hannah Reed *** 14/06/2018 9:58:00 AM
Hi Team,
I was called this evening by the tenant of unit 7/11 Tooral drive Buderim, tenant is Steve Paige at 9.39pm. 
Sounds like there is a water leak in wall directly behind toilet, I have advised him to turn off rain water tank pump as toilets are supplied water by rain water tanks and I can inspect in morning, please advise if this is ok to attend to thank you. 

*** Hannah Reed *** 15/11/2017 1:22:41 PM
Mobbs Electrical have been out and could not find anything wrng with the oven at all, and the oven seal is completely fine. 

*** Hannah Reed *** 6/11/2017 12:01:41 PM
Thanks Hannah.
Can we please proceed with the Omega oven.

Good afternoon J
 
After receiving the work order yesterday Chris phoned the tenant and he advised that the smoke alarm has since corrected itself in the last 3 days and the tenant was happy to leave it at that for now.
 
As these are hardwired alarms, it would be prudent to send an electrician rather than Chris – IF it goes off again. Just thought I would advise J
 
Kind Regards,
Teagan

to me 
Hi Hannah,
 
Thanks for your email.
The builder of stage 1 no longer exists. (Under that company name anyway)
As this is private property, it is not body corporate responsibility. I would suggest the owner contact the QBCC to see if there would be any rectification from the builders insurance. http://www.qbcc.qld.gov.au/building-complaints/overview

I then spoke to Bob from Energy resources, told him of the current situation, he advised that the debt would be put with debt collectors to chase the old tenant up, and because of the mess up with accounts and so forth that the previous electricity providers left the resort in, that they had now been left to tidy things up and that it would be quite difficult to shut the power off to one unit. They would have to manually go into the unit to shut the power off.
He advised that the power would not be disconnected to the unit as this was a new customer and account. 
I then spoke to Melody from Body Corp she put me on hold and she then spoke to Brendon, she come back and advised that there was nothing written in the contracts or laws that the owners would be responsible for the electricity accounts should the tenants not pay their outstanding accounts. Brendon was going to look into it further and get back to me although as they said, its a grey area and nothing was in writing that they could provide me with to suggest otherwise.
